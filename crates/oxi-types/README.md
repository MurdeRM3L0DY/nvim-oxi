# nvim-types

This crate contains the Rust bindings to the C types used internally by Neovim.
It was originally ported from
[`turboladen/overkill_nvim`](https://github.com/turboladen/overkill_nvim/tree/develop/neovim_sys/src/api/nvim)
but diverged significantly over time. Of course, all bugs are mine :)
